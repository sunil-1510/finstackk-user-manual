![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep2-1.png)

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep2-2.png)

- When entering your email ID, make sure that you use the correct email address that you used to register for the account. If you have multiple email IDs, double-check that you are using the correct one for this specific account. It is important to ensure that your email ID is entered accurately as it is used to verify your identity and send you important notifications and updates.

- Ensure that there are no typos or spelling errors in your email ID. Sometimes it can be easy to misspell or mistype an email address, which could result in not being able to log in to your account. It is also important to make sure that you use the correct capitalization and punctuation when entering your email ID.

- If you enter an incorrect or invalid email ID, you will not be able to log in to your account.

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep3-3.png)

- Make sure that you enter your password carefully and double-check that it is correct before clicking the "Sign In" button.

- It is important to keep your password confidential and not share it with anyone. Also, make sure that your password is unique and not used for any other accounts. This can help prevent unauthorized access to your account.

- After entering your correct email ID and password and clicking on the "Sign In" button, you will be directed to the Two Factor Authentication page where you will need to enter a code sent to your email to complete the login process. This provides an extra layer of security for your account.

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep3-4.png)

- In case you have forgotten your password, you can click on the "Forgot Password" button on the login page so that you can reset the password for a smooth further login.

**Step 4:** Two Factor Authentication(2FA)

At FinStackk, we take the security of our users' accounts very seriously, and we are proud to offer 2FA as an option for our users. 

- Two-Factor Authentication, or 2FA, is an additional layer of security that helps protect your account from unauthorized access. With 2FA, you need to provide two forms of identification to log in to your account: your password and a verification code that is generated by a trusted device or application. This makes it much harder for someone to hack into your account even if they have your password.

- Two-factor authentication typically involves providing an additional verification code sent to your phone number after entering your password. This step ensures that only authorized users can access your account, even if your password is compromised.

- During the login process, you will be prompted to the 2FA setup method. A dropdown menu or a list of countries will be provided. You have to select your country from the available options and enter your phone number in the designated field, including the country code.

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep4-1.png)

- The country code is a numerical prefix that identifies the country your phone number belongs to. It is usually represented by a "+" sign followed by the country code. For example, the country code for the United States is "+1", for the United Kingdom is "+44", and so on.

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep4-2.png)

- Make sure to enter your phone number accurately, including any necessary area or regional codes.

- Once you have entered your phone number, click on the "Update Phone Number" button.

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep4-3.png)

- A verification code will be sent to the phone number you provided via SMS or text message.

- Retrieve the verification code from your mobile device and enter it into the designated field on the 2FA page.

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep4-4.png)

- If you did not receive the verification code, you can click on the "Resend OTP" button to request another code.

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep4-5.png)

- Make sure to enter the verification code accurately. Once you have entered the correct verification code, click on the "Verify" or "Submit" button to complete the 2FA setup process.

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep4-6.png)

- If the verification code is valid and matches the one sent to your mobile number, your 2FA setup will be successfully completed.

- You cannot use an invalid OTP. When entering the One-Time Password (OTP) during the verification process, please make sure you enter the correct code provided to you. If you enter an incorrect OTP, you will receive a message indicating that the OTP is invalid.

![Alt Text](Images/LoginStep4-7.png)

- From that point forward, whenever you log in to your account, you will be prompted to enter a verification code that will be sent to your registered phone number. 

If you have any questions regarding to your account login, please feel free to contact our customer support care. We are always ready to help you.
